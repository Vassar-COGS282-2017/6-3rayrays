# Lab 9: Classifying handwritten digits with a neural network

In this lab, you'll build a three-layer neural network for classifying handwriting. The dataset
contains 70,000 examples of written digits (0-9) from Census workers and high school students.
Each digit is a 28x28 matrix, with values between 0 and 1 corresponding to the level of brightness
of the pixel. Here is a sample of images from the data set:

You can open the load-mnist-data.R file to learn a bit more about the dataset.

### Building the network

The backprop-network.R file will walk you through the steps of building the network. 
The comments in the code are essential for guiding you through the process.
